  abstract  = {Kinematic relationships between degrees of freedom, also named multi-point constraints, are frequently used in structural mechanics. In this paper, the Craig variant of the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization algorithm is used as an iterative method to solve the arising linear system with a saddle point structure. The condition number of the preconditioned operator is shown to be close to unity and independent of the mesh size. This property is proved theoretically and illustrated on a sequence of test problems of increasing complexity, including concrete structures enforced with pretension cables and the coupled finite element model of a reactor containment building. The Golub-Kahan algorithm converges in only a small number of steps for all considered test problems and discretization sizes. Furthermore, it is robust in practical cases that are otherwise considered to be difficult for iterative solvers.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we introduce a novel <em>hp</em>-adaptive strategy. The main goal is to minimize the complexity and implementational efforts hence increasing the robustness of the algorithm while keeping close to optimal numerical results. We employ a multi-level hierarchical data structure imposing Dirichlet nodes to manage the so-called hanging nodes. The <em>hp</em>-adaptive strategy is based on performing quasi-optimal unrefinements. Taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the basis functions both in terms of the element size <em>h</em> and the polynomial order of approximation <em>p</em>, we mark those with the lowest contributions to the energy of the solution and remove them. This straightforward unrefinement strategy does not need from a fine grid or complex data structures, making the algorithm flexible to many practical situations and existing implementations. On the other side, we also identify some limitations of the proposed strategy, namely: (a) data structures only support isotropic <em>h</em>-refinements (although <em>p</em>-anisotropic refinements are enabled), (b) we assume certain quasi-orthogonality properties of the basis functions in the energy norm, and (c) in this work, we restrict to symmetric and positive definite problems. We illustrate these and other advantages and limitations of the proposed <em>hp</em>-adaptive strategy with several one-, two- and three-dimensional Poisson examples.},

  abstract = {We propose a set of numerical methods for the computation of the frequency-dependent effective primary wave (P-wave) velocity of heterogeneous rocks. We assume the rock's internal microstructure is provided by given micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images. In the low/medium frequency regime, we propose to solve the acoustic equation in the frequency domain by a Finite Element Method (FEM). We employ a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to truncate the computational domain and we show the need to repeat the domain a sufficient number of times to obtain accurate results. To make this problem computationally tractable, we equip the FEM with non-fitting meshes and we precompute multiple blocks of the stiffness matrix. In the high-frequency range, we solve the eikonal equation with the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The results computed via this method match for vertical transversely isotropic media (VTI) with the effective compressional wave velocity calculated by the Wyllie-time-average formula. Extensive numerical results confirm the validity of the proposed methods and illustrate the effect of density, porosity, and the size and distribution of the pores on the effective compressional wave velocity.},

We also provide guidelines for finding operators delivering sharp error representation upper bounds. We further extend the results to a convection‐dominated diffusion problem as well as to problems with discontinuous material coefficients. Finally, we consider a sonic logging‐while‐drilling problem to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In Goal-Oriented Adaptivity (GOA), the error in a Quantity of Interest (QoI) is represented using global error functions of the direct and adjoint problems. This error representation is subsequently bounded above by element-wise error indicators that are used to drive optimal refinements. In this work, we propose to replace, in the error representation, the adjoint problem by an alternative operator. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that, when judiciously selecting such alternative operator, the corresponding upper bound of the error representation becomes sharper, leading to a more efficient GOA. These representations can be employed to design novel <em>h</em>, <em>p</em>, and <em>hp</em> energy-norm and goal-oriented adaptive algorithms. While the method can be applied to a variety of problems, in this Dissertation we first focus on one-dimensional (1D) problems, including Helmholtz and steady state convection-dominated diffusion problems. Numerical results in 1D show that for the Helmholtz problem, it is advantageous to select the Laplace operator for the alternative error representation. Specifically, the upper bounds of the new error representation are sharper than the classical ones used in both energy-norm and goal-oriented adaptive methods, especially when the dispersion (pollution) error is significant. The 1D steady state convection-dominated diffusion problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions exhibits a boundary layer that produces a loss of numerical stability. The new error representation based on the Laplace operator delivers sharper error upper bounds. When applied to a <em>p</em>-GOA, the alternative error representation captures earlier the boundary layer, despite the existing spurious numerical oscillations. We then focus on the two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) Helmholtz equation. We show via extensive numerical experimentation that the upper bounds provided by the alternative error representations are sharper than the classical ones. When using the alternative error indicators, a naive p-adaptive process converges, whereas under the same conditions, the classical method fails and requires the use of the so-called Projection Based Interpolation (PBI) operator or some other technique to regain convergence. We also provide guidelines for finding operators delivering sharp error representation upper bounds.},
